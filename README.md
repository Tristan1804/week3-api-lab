This API provides authentication and product management services using Express.js. The authentication service (running on ports 3000 and 3001) allows users to register (POST /api/register), log in (POST /api/login), and access a protected route (GET /api/protected) using JWT authentication. The product service (running on port 4000) provides a list of available products through (GET /api/products). Passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt, and authentication is handled via JWT tokens. To run the API, install dependencies (npm install), set environment variables (SECRET_KEY in .env), and start the servers (node server.js).
